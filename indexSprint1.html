      <h1>Khabib to Conor: "It is the same thing"</h1>
      <p>It's the same thing as the previous fight. If it's a first round finish, I'd back Conor.
        From the second and futher, then Dustin wins.
      </p>
      <p>The Russian - who retired in March with a record 29-0 with eight knockouts - has submission victories over both 
        McGregor and Poirier, so he knows a thing or two about their game plans and skillsets.
      </p>
      <p>He memorably scaled the Octagon at UFC 229 after defeating McGregor to attack hos cornerman Dillion Danis, who had 
        reportedly shouted insults at Khabib following the fight. The Russian has turned to promoting following his retirement 
        and is mentoring fellow lightweight Islam Makhachev - currently ranked #9 in the UFC rankings.
